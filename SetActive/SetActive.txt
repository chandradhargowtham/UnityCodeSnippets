SetActive Activates/Deactivates the GameObject, depending on the given true or false value.

		gameObject.SetActive()

Ex:

1. Define a game object and assign a reference to it. 

		public Toggle t1;

2. In Update() or your custom function,

        t1.gameObject.SetActive(false);

Note: Using t1.SetActive will not work. Hierarchy needs to be followed.
