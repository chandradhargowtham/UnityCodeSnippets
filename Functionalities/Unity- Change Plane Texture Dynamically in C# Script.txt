Change Plane Texture Dynamically in C# Script

1. Create a Plane/cube and make sure there is a mesh renderer option on them(It is added by default).

2. Import or create a texture. 
3. If imported a Image (Ex: png), click on it and change its Texture Type to Sprite(2D and UI) and click on apply.
4.
Code: 
	
	 1. Create a renderer at the beginning of the script.
	 2. Assign a component to the renderer before trying to access it(Ideally in the start function, but can be assigned the line before assigning texture. ).
	 3.	 	
	 	Ex: public GameObject Cube123; // Assign the cube in the inspector
	 		public  Texture[] Flags = new Texture[10] ; //Assign textures to the array

	 		Renderer rend; 

	 		rend = Cube123.GetComponent<Renderer>();
        	rend.material.mainTexture = Flags[counter]; // Create an array or just a single texture.

     4. We can also change the color of the cube/plane using the same method.

   	        rend.material.color = Color.black;

   	 5. We can also modify the Shader: 

   	 		rend.material.Shader = Shader.Find("Transparent/Diffuse");
