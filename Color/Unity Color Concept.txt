Unity Color Class:


To change color, we can use folowing methods:

	> bkg.color = Color.blue;

To change color by assigning custom values:

1. bkg.color = new Color(1f,0f,0f,.85f);

	>  Here, the Color Constructor takes either 3 or 4 values - RGB and (4th param) Alpha Value for transparency.
	>  All the parameters are in float format and only take values from 0.0 to 1.0.

2. bkg.color = new Color32(255,0,0,90);

	>  To specifically use 0 to 255 values, use Color32 which takes Byte parameters.

3. bkg.color = new Color(255/255,0/255,0/255,90);

	>  Also gives same output as above.
