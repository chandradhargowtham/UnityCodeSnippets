Unity UI Text

> Can be accessed in the Visual Studio using the keyword Text.
> MUST include the import directive 'using UnityEngine.UI' for all UI elements.

Example: 

public class ToggleText : MonoBehaviour
{
    public Text tt; // this must be referenced in unity to the corresponding text object.
    
    // Start is called before the first frame update
    void Start()
    {
        tt.text = "Initialized";
    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {
        tt.text = Time.time.ToString(); //Updates every frame
    }
}


>	Requires ToString() as the output is a string and the format isn't a string - In the above example, time is in float format.

> 	Depending on the conditions, TEXTNAME.text can be updated.
