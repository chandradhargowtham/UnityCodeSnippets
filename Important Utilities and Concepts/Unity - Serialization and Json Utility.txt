Unity - Serialization and Json Utility

Usage: 
When we want to save a value or a class, we use the Json utility to convert from strings to Json and vice versa. In order to do that conversion, we need the variable or class to be serializable.

"Serialization is the automatic process of transforming data structures or object states into a format that Unity can store and reconstruct later. Some of Unity’s built-in features use serialization; features such as saving and loading".

We need to use the keywords

[System.Serializable] to serialize the entire class
or
[SerializeItem] to serialize that one field(like Text,GameObject etc)


Note:

1. Serializers in Unity run in a real-time game environment.
2. This has a significant impact on performance.
3. Also make sure it:
	Is public, or has a SerializeField attribute
	Is not static
	Is not const
	Is not readonly
	Has a fieldtype that can be serialized

Json Utility:

Json Utility Details and Syntax can be found in the Saving Game Text File.
JsonUtility.fromJson sometimes may not work when the class you want to serialize isn't derived from monobehaviour. Ex: scriptable Object.
In order for it to work, we can use JsonUtility.FromJsonOverwrite.
